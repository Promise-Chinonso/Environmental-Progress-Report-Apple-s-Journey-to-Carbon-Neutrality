### Environmental Progress Report: Apple's Journey to Carbon Neutrality

#### Background
The emission of toxic gases into the environment undoubtedly has a negative impact on human health. Industrial activities from companies worldwide are among the leading forces behind the increased emission of toxic gases into the atmosphere.

In 2020, Apple, a leading tech company, resolved to make the environment more friendly by reducing the amount of greenhouse gas emitted from its industrial processes and products. The goal is to reduce the emission of GHG (Greenhouse Gases) by 75% by 2030, using its total emission in 2015 as the baseline value.

This project aims to assess the progress made and identify patterns that could enhance efficiency in the journey towards achieving carbon neutrality by Apple.

#### About The Data
Tables containing details on gas emissions by year, product lifecycle and corporate emissions and product's carbon footprint were collected and analyzed. The details contained in the dataset were enough to help achieve the goal of this project. 

Tool: Microsoft Power BI was used for the entire analytical process.

#### Data Cleaning and Transformation
This step was carried out in Microsoft's Power Query editor. Some issues with the dataset include the presence of null values, inconsistent column naming conventions, values requiring conversions, and incorrect data types. There were no duplicates or outliers detected.

The data was cleaned and transfromed before proceeding to the next step.

#### Data Model 
Relationships were carefully established among all four tables to ensure accurate analysis and seamless coordination of data. This structured connection enhances the reliability and depth of insights drawn from the details contained within the tables.

Measures were created to extract values that were originally not contained in the data.
